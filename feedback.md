## Code Quality

Progressing - I would use a folder to store all of your images. I would also remove unused code in production. I would also use a formatter so that your code is consistent, especially the JavaScript file. I'd also remove commented code, that's what git is for!

## Technical Requirements

Performing - Your app runs really well! Awesome job!

## Creativity & Interface

Progressing - I like how you used a modal and have dynamic elements on your page. I'd keep working on adding more CSS to make the page really go beyond the default browser CSS.

## Functionality

Performing - Your game works as expected!

## Presentation

Performing - I would use a `.gitignore` so that .DS_Store isn't pushed! Good job making a ReadME! I'd keep adding to it with the technologies you used, future issues, etc.

Great job on this project! You did a great job implementing the game logic!
