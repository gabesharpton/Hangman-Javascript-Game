/*
            --------------------Basics of what I need------------------
A basic function to guess the word you input first.
You get 6 wrong guesses
A key board with each letter of the alphabet
A guess line with underscores for how many letters the hidden word has
The letter dissapears after selected
If the letter is correct display on guess line, if not it will take away a guess and display body part



            --------------------Extra I would like------------------
Random letter bank
has random button option instead of word you choose
Maybe add pictures instead of letter for body parts
